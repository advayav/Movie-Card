# Movie-Card

This is a project made in React.
The project allows the user to view movies that are currently popular as well as search for movies that they do not see on the list currently. In addition to this, the user can also add movies to their list of favorites. All these favorite movies can then be viewed later on a different page of the web application

To run this project, once the code is downloaded, you would need to run npm install in the terminal to install the dependencies required for the code to run. Once the dependencies have been installed, you can run npm run dev on the command line in order to run the application.

This project was made with the help of a YouTube tutorial by TechwithTim: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=G6D9cBaLViA&t=371s
